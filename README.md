# **Why Liquio?**

* **Open source edition**
  Liquio Community Edition enables governments to keep control of the product and  ensures digital sovereignty by providing transparent, open-source technology that internal teams can own, adapt, and scale according to national priorities.
* **Low-code approach** 
  By minimizing complex coding, low-code enables analysts and service designers to focus on service logic, policy rules, and citizen experience — rather than technical implementation.
* **Average time to launch a service: 1.5 months**
  Due to ready made components, you can devote most of the timeline to service design. Citizens will get essential, user-friendly services as quickly as possible.
* **Engineered for thousands of requests per second**
  Stay confident in stable service operation even during nationwide traffic peaks. Liquio’s microservices architecture automatically scales to meet demand.
* **Cost-efficient adaptability**
  Respond flexibly to legislative changes and update services without full rewrites—saving time and budget.  
* **Best-practice modules**
  Use ready-made components built on our extensive public-sector experience. Services are assembled through visual tools and configurable modules, reducing the need for complex custom programming.  
* **Multiple teams, parallel outcomes**
  Enable different teams to build and launch services simultaneously, accelerating digital transformation.  
* **Battle-tested in Ukraine**
  Liquio powers over 200 government IT solutions for national and municipal authorities.  
  One of the flagship cases is Diia — Ukraine’s national e-governance portal delivering used by over 23 million people.
